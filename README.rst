===================
ckanext-downloadall
===================

This CKAN extension adds a "Download all" button to datasets. This downloads
a zip file containing all the resource files and a datapackage.json.

.. image:: demo.png

This zip file is a good way to package data for storing or sending, because:

* you keep all the data files together

* you include the documentation (metadata) - avoids the common problem of being
  handed some data files and not know anything about it or where to find info

* the metadata is machine-readable, so can be used by tools, software and in
  automated workflows. For example:

  * validating a series of data releases all meet a standard schema
  * loading it into a database, using the column types and foreign key
    relations specified in the metadata

The `datapackage.json <https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/>`_ is a
`Frictionless Data <https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/>`_
standard, also known as a Data Package.


Technical notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the resource is pushed/xloaded to DataStore then the schema (column types)
is also included in the datapackage.json file.

This extension uses a hybrid approach for zip generation:

* **Small datasets** (total resource size below the configured threshold) use a
  background job to pre-generate the zip every time the dataset is created or
  updated (or its data dictionary is changed). The resulting zip is stored in
  the CKAN filestore and served directly on demand. This suits CKANs where all
  files are uploaded - if the underlying data file changes without the CKAN URL
  changing, then the zip will not include the update (until something else
  triggers the zip to update).

* **Large datasets** (total resource size at or above the configured threshold)
  are never pre-generated. Instead, the zip is assembled on the fly and streamed
  directly to the browser when the user clicks "Download all", without consuming
  any additional disk space. The threshold is configurable - see
  ``ckanext.downloadall.stream_threshold_bytes`` in the Config Settings section.

(This extension is inspired by `ckanext-packagezip
<https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-packagezip>`_, but that is old and relied
on ckanext-archiver and IPipe.)

Requirements
------------

=============== =============
CKAN version    Compatibility
=============== =============
2.8 and earlier no
2.9             yes
2.10            yes - not tested though
2.11 and later  unknown
=============== =============

Designed to work with CKAN 2.9+

Ideally it is used in conjunction with DataStore and
`xloader <https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-xloader>`_ (or datapusher), so that the
Data Dictionary is included as a schema in the datapackage.json, to describe
the column types.

------------
Installation
------------

To install ckanext-downloadall:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example::

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Install the ckanext-downloadall Python package into your virtual environment::

     pip install ckanext-downloadall

3. Add ``downloadall`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``). e.g. ::

     ckan.plugins = downloadall

4. Restart the CKAN worker. For example if you've deployed it with supervisord::

     sudo supervisorctl restart ckan-worker:ckan-worker-00

5. Restart CKAN server. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on
   Ubuntu::

     sudo service apache2 reload

6. Ensure the background job 'worker' process is running - see
https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/background-tasks.html#running-background-jobs


---------------
Config Settings
---------------

::

    # Total resource size in bytes at or above which a dataset's "Download all"
    # zip is streamed on demand instead of being pre-generated and stored in the
    # filestore. Set to 0 to stream all datasets. Set to a very large value to
    # effectively disable streaming and pre-generate everything.
    # (optional, default: 104857600 = 100 MB).
    ckanext.downloadall.stream_threshold_bytes = 104857600

    # Include additional fields from the dataset in the datapackage.json (e.g.
    # those defined in a ckanext-scheming schema)
    # (optional, space separated list).
    ckanext.downloadall.dataset_fields_to_add_to_datapackage = district county


----------------------
Command-line interface
----------------------

There is a command-line interface::

    downloadall --help

Examples of use::

    downloadall update-zip gold-prices
    downloadall update-all-zips


---------------
Troubleshooting
---------------

**"All resource data" appears as a normal resource, instead of seeing a
"Download All" button**

You need to enable this extension in the CKAN config and restart the server.
See the Installation section above.

**ImportError: No module named datapackage**

This means you have an older version of ckanapi, which is a dependency of
ckanext-downloadall. Install a newer version.

**OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/data/ckan/resources/c89'**

You are trying to update zips from the command-line but running the tasks
synchronously, rather than with the normal worker process. In this case you
need to run it as the `www-data` user e.g.::

    sudo -u www-data /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/downloadall -c /etc/ckan/default/production.ini update-all-zips --synchronous

------------------------
Development Installation
------------------------

To install ckanext-downloadall for development, activate your CKAN virtualenv
and do::

    git clone https://github.com/davidread/ckanext-downloadall.git
    cd ckanext-downloadall
    python setup.py develop
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Remember to run the worker (in a separate terminal)::

    paster --plugin=ckan jobs worker --config=/etc/ckan/default/development.ini


-----------------
Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests, do::

    nosetests --nologcapture --with-pylons=test.ini

To run the tests and produce a coverage report, first make sure you have
coverage installed in your virtualenv (``pip install coverage``) then run::

    nosetests --nologcapture --with-pylons=test.ini --with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.downloadall --cover-inclusive --cover-erase --cover-tests


----------------------------------------------
Releasing a New Version of ckanext-downloadall
----------------------------------------------

ckanext-downloadall is availabe on PyPI as https://pypi.org/project/ckanext-downloadall/.
To publish a new version to PyPI follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in the ``setup.py`` file.
   See `PEP 440 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers>`_
   for how to choose version numbers.

2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of this release.

3. Make sure you have the latest version of necessary packages::

       pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

4. Create a source and binary distributions of the new version::

       python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && twine check dist/*

   Fix any errors you get.

5. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

       twine upload dist/*

6. Commit any outstanding changes::

       git commit -a
       git push

7. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.1 then do::

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags
